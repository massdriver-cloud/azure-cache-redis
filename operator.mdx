This bunde builds the Azure Redis Cache resource, creates a static private IP address, and associates it to the connected virtual network by use of the default subnet ID.

## Use Cases

Bundle for provisioning the Azure Redis Cache resource in Azure.

### Guided Configs
Small and Highly Available
- Sets Redis version to 6
- capacity: 6GB
- replicas_per_primary: 1
- high_availability: true

"Medium and Highly Available"
- redis_version: 6
- capacity: 26GB
- replicas_per_primary: 2
- high_availability: true

"Large and Highly Available"
- redis_version: 6
- capacity: 120GB
- replicas_per_primary: 3
- high_availability: true

## Design

### How It Works
